# Hearth - Gamified Household Chores Android App
## Overview
Hearth is an Android app designed to bring a sense of fun to household chores. It gamifies the chore experience by allowing parents to create lists of tasks. When children complete these tasks, they earn rewards in the form of gold and experience points. Gold can be spent on rewards from the in-app shop, which parents can curate. The total family experience serves as a score for leaderboards, encouraging friendly competition within the family.
